## How to Run
To run the extension in Firefox you have to manually install it. This is necessary because it uses Experiments and as such will not be signed. This also means it requires Firefox Nightly or Firefox Developer Edition. Also make sure that the preference `extensions.experiments.enabled` is turned on. Then open `about:debugging`, select `This Nightly` and install it via `Install temporary extension` by selecting the `manifest.json` file located under `src`.
